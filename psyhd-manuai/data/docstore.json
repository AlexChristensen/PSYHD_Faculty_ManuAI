\n \nThe priorities of Peabody College are for students to be successful in their academic programs \nand to maintain a healthy work -life balance. To support these priorities, p lease follow the \nguidelines and procedures below in regard to maximum number of hours per week for which on \ncampus graduate and professional students may be employed.   \n  \nPhD Students (Graduate)  \n \nPhD students who have  not yet achieved doctoral candidacy may be employed for up to 20 hours \nper week (29.5 in the summer, provided no courses are taken). PhD students who have achieved \ndoctoral candidacy may work up to 29.5 hours per week in the fall or spring with the approv al of \ntheir advisor, Director of Graduate Studies, and the Peabody Dean\u2019s Office.  \n \nEdD Students (Professional)  \n \nBecause students enrolled in the weekend Ed .D. program  of the Department of Leadership, \nPolicy, and Organizations (LPO) take only six credit hours per semester, they may work full \ntime at Vanderbilt University or elsewhere. No prior approval from the Peabody Dean\u2019s Office is \nrequired.   \n   \nMaster\u2019s  Students (Professional)  \n \nMaster\u2019s students (M.Ed. or M.P.P.) may be employed for up to 20 hours per week  during the \nacademic year . Master\u2019s students may work up to an additional 9.5 hours per week (29.5 hours \ntotal) if the work is supported by sponsored fu nding sources (i.e .grants and contracts) with the \napproval of their advisor, program director, department, and the Peabody Dean\u2019s Office. In an \neffort to extend Peabody employment opportunities to as many students as possible, 20 hours per \nweek is the max imum  for master\u2019s students employed through non -sponsored funding sources.  \n \n \nPlease see the college guidelines on classification and compensation, Professional Student \nEmployment Classification and Compensation , to determine the correct job title and \ncompe nsation rate for professional students.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e914135-a8f4-46ee-9b80-69a0f6d1ac12": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e914135-a8f4-46ee-9b80-69a0f6d1ac12", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "External_Letters.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a4ec9c32-ca04-4cc8-b499-0cae21ba52c7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "External_Letters.pdf"}, "hash": "75efd30fac4d7c36abd950a119c839bdfef0960ea12420a9ac32c1fef4b2d1d0"}}, "hash": "998cecad4eda68b40050f31b376c619444c4a3ad7e3350392508e15fe3ecf67f", "text": "Procedures for Obtaining External Letters for Tenure Review  \n \n(Created: 11/09 ; Revised: 10/16  & 06/17) \n \nExternal review letters are a critical piece of the promotion and/or tenure dossier. It is im portant \nthat the steps below are followed so that the required number and type of letters are received.  \nThe names of external reviewers who were asked to write letters, the names of those who wrote \nletters, and the letters themselves are confidential and shall not be revealed to the candidate.  \nThe department al review committee is responsible for obtaining at least six letters from \nreviewers external to the University. At least three of the six letters are to be from a list of six \nreferees proposed by the candidate. The remaining letters (a minimum of three \u2014 and preferably \nmore than three) are solicited from a list of external reviewers selected by the committee.   A \ntarget of eight letters is recommended.  \nThe reviewers should be selected not only on the basis of their credentials, but also because their \nreviews  would be expected to be unbiased. The reviewers should have no professional or personal \ninterest in the candidate's promotion or tenure, as might be expected of a dissertation or thesis \nadvisor, co -investigator on a grant, co -author, classmate, former col league, a person who has \nsupplied a letter of recommendation for the candidate, etc.  \nNormally, external reviewers will be full professors from distinguished universities with \nexemplary programs or faculty in the relevant field, preferably from those in th e top 25 in that \nfield. If exceptions to this guideline are proposed, they must be justified in the initial request to the \nDean.  \nIn the spring of the academic year prior to the one in which the tenure/promotion review is to be \ncompleted:   \n1. Obtain from the  tenure/promotion candidate the names, titles, brief bio -sketches, \nand contact information for at least six prospective external reviewers. Although the \nUniversity is obligated to use names from a candidate's list, the reviewers the \ncandidate suggests wil l be most credible if they meet the guidelines  above . The \nreview committee needs to give the candidate a specific deadline for completion of \nthis step.  \n2. With the candidate's list in hand, the faculty review committee identifies at least six \nadditional prosp ective external reviewers and prepares a brief bio -sketch for each. \nThe candidate's list and the committee's list must not overlap.  \n3. The candidate's list, the committee's list, and all bio -sketches are submitted to the \nDean. This material must be in the form of a memorandum  in which the source of \neach name (i.e., candidate or committee) is identified.

However, requests to utilize College summer \nfunds to work on other expected milestones  to comp lete the PhD program , such as the Major Area Paper, \nwill not be considered.  University policy  limits students to working a maximum of 1, 560 total hours in a \ncalendar year  (which covers spring semester, summer, and fall semester) . Thus, the following limits  \napply:  \n \n\u2022 Fall & spring semesters: 20 hours/week, with exceptions considered for 29.5 hours/week  \n\u2022 Summer  break : 20 hours/week , with exceptions considered for 40 hours/week  \n \nPhD students can work up to 2 half -time summer months at 20 hours/week using any funding source. For  \nthis arrangement, students do not need to seek approval from the Associate Dean. The 2 half -time months  \ncan be solely from College funds, solely from external grant funds, or a combination of College and  \nexternal grant funds.  For any ar rangement that extends beyond 2 half -time summer months at 20 \nhours/week, students must  submit an additional work hours request via InfoReady . \n \nTo work up to 2.5 half -time summer months at 20 hours/week, the following must apply:  \n- Only external grants fun ds are used . \n- Only 1 College half -time month at 20 hours/week is used, combined with the student\u2019s  \nadvisor/supervisor utilizing 1.5 half -time summer months at 20 hours/week to support the student  \nfrom their College (e.g., faculty start -up funds, Endowed c hair funds) and/or external grant funds . \n \nFinally, if summer funding does not rely on College summer funds in any form, in exceptionally rare  \noccasions (see below for details), PhD students may be able to work a maximum of 2.5 summer months at  \na maximum of 40 hours/week. This arrangement requires Associate Dean approval and a compelling  \nrationale must be provided.  \n \nProcedure for Requesting PhD Summer Funds  via InfoReady : \n \n1.  The student should consult their faculty mentor/supervisor and provide a written statement of the  \nspecific research they aim to accomplish during the supported summer time, detailing all forms \nof funds and funding sources they will receive for the summer, as well as the specific \nresponsibilities  associated with those funds. This written statement must also include a clear \ndescription of the total  hours the student has worked during the spring semester and anticipates \nworking in the upcoming fall  semester as there are calendar year limits.  \n \n2.  The student\u2019s faculty mentor/supervisor should carefully review the student\u2019s request and, if they  \napprove, should provide the student a brief written statement for inclusion in the request \nconfirming  the student is in good standing, indicating that they are supportive of the student \nreceiving the College  funds to work on the noted research (if applicable), verifying that no \nalternative summer funds (e.g.,  external grant, faculty start -up funds, Endowed chair funds ) are \navailable to support the student (if  applicable), and/or explaining the rationale for requesting that", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e64db1e0-6b01-4fb0-aff1-649b56e59309": {"__data__": {"id_": "e64db1e0-6b01-4fb0-aff1-649b56e59309", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Graduate_Summer_Funding.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "997656c7-c4ef-4683-8a73-4a7d241ce46f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Graduate_Summer_Funding.pdf"}, "hash": "d4af769e231c00821ec6b155bc057c60c41d188d3426eef6d541349ab42aa057"}}, "hash": "d0dd1b2c103bd5e48a944fc3bb183338c8cd666ed3ba392badf82ac45023cadc", "text": "the student work beyond 20  hours/week (e.g., when utilizing only external grant funds, but \nrequesting that the student work up to  40 hours/week for 2.5 summer months).  \n \n3.

A paid leave of \nabsence may be granted to a faculty member -by the Provost, or the Dean of the School of \nMedicine for faculty in the School of Medicine Clinical Departments, for research or other \nacademic pursuits by the faculty member. Such research can consist of special projects, \nincluding out -of-town research, study, writing for publication, or some other  \nactivityconsistentwitha scholarlypurpose.  \nEach college and school should provide a statement of principles and procedures regarding its \nleave policy.

Limitations  \nThe parental leave benefit may be used once per child and no more than three times during a \nfaculty member\u2019s employment at Vanderbilt.  \n8. Multiple Bi rths/Adoptions  \nFor purposes of this policy, parental leave in the case of multiple birth (twins, triplets, etc.) or \nsimultaneous adoption of multiple children shall count as one leave event, resulting \nautomatically in the availability of one semester of pa id leave. Thus, the birth of triplets would \nnot use up the faculty member\u2019s eligibility for parental leave for future births or adoptions nor \nwould it necessarily entitle the faculty member to three consecutive semesters of paid leave.

Neither FMLA nor TMLA requires that the \nperson taking leave for infant care be the primary caregiver.  \n1.

Any medical leave (under Section D below) that a f aculty member takes \nthat would qualify as permissible leave under the FMLA will automatically count as part of the \ntwelve (12) weeks of leave allowed under the FMLA. However, if a faculty member wishes, \nthey/she/he may seek to take leave under the Tennesse e Maternity Leave Act, as well as under \nthe FMLA. This will allow the faculty member an additional thirty (30) days leave over and \nabove the twelve (12) weeks of leave under the FMLA.

Except to the \nextent that a faculty member is entitled to pay on account of the university\u2019s parental leave \npolicy or under the short -term medical leave policy, TMLA leave is unpaid.  \nAn eligible faculty member must give their/her/his department chair or division director (or dean \nif there is no departmental organization) at least three (3) months\u2019 written notice  of their \nintention to take TMLA leave, the anticipated date of departure and the expected date of return to \nfull-time work. A medical emergency that prevents the giving of three months\u2019 notice will not \ndisqualify an eligible faculty member from obtaining TMLA leave. However, the faculty \nmember should state in writing, as soon as possible, their intention to be on TMLA leave for a \nspecified period and their intention to return to full -time work by a designated date within four \nmonths. For faculty members on  academic -year appointments, if the expiration of the period of \nTMLA leave occurs between the spring and fall semesters, the faculty member will not be \nrequired to return to work until the start of the fall semester.  \nThe period of TMLA leave for faculty me mbers will generally be composed of leave for short -\nterm illness (paid) and personal leave (unpaid), with the division determined by the appropriate \ndean.

Illness or Other Incapacities of Short Duration (Medical Leave)  \nWhen a faculty member must be absent from their/her/his du ties because of their own illness or \nincapacity of short duration (six months or less), other members of the faculty, with knowledge \nof the department chair or division director and the dean, customarily assume their duties on a \ntemporary basis.

Intermittent leave requires Occupational \nHealth to determine from a Certification of Health Care Provi der form that a qualifying medical \ncondition necessitates the requested schedule. The faculty member must provide medical \ncertification and advance leave notice. Leave may be denied if these requirements are not met. \nThe faculty member ordinarily must prov ide thirty days\u2019 advance notice when the leave is \nforeseeable.

Specific dates for the leave should be stated \nin the request. Such leaves usually do not extend beyond one year. If approved by the Dean, the \nrequest for leave for personal reasons is handled in the same way as academic leave, going to the \nProvost for review and approval. The Dean of the School of Medicine will consider and approve \nsuch leaves for faculty in the School of Medicine Clinical Departments. Faculty members must \nconfirm with Human Resource Servi ces in advance of the unpaid leave whether they want \nbenefits to continue, and, if so, make arrangements to pay for them.  \n2. Military Duty  \nCertain faculty members may have rights under the Uniformed Services Employment and \nReemployment Rights Act (\u201cUSSERA\u201d ). USERRA protects the job rights of individuals who \nvoluntarily or involuntarily leave employment to undertake military service or certain types of \nservice in the National Disaster Medical System. USERRA prohibits employers from \ndiscriminating against pas t and present members of the uniformed services and applicants to the \nuniformed services. If a faculty member has questions about their/her/his rights relating to \nmilitary obligations, they should communicate with the dean of their school.  \n[6] Faculty memb ers are eligible if they have worked for the University for at least one year and \nfor 1,250 hours during the previous twelve months. Unpaid leave is granted for any of the \nfollowing reasons: to care for the faculty member\u2019s newborn child after birth or pla cement for \nadoption or foster care, and to care for the faculty member\u2019s spouse, son or daughter, or parent \nwho has a serious health condition, as documented by a Certification of Health Care Provider \nform submitted to Occupational Health. [6] The 12 weeks  of FMLA medical leave discussed in \nthis section run concurrently with, and are not in addition to, the 12 weeks of FMLA family \nleave addressed in Section C of this chapter.  \n3. Medical Leave for Care of Family Members  \nAs required by the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), Vanderbilt provides up to twelve \nweeks of unpaid,7 job-protected leave to eligible faculty members for care of a faculty member\u2019s \nseriously ill spouse, dependent child, or parent.  \n4. FMLA Leave Relating to Military Obligations  \nA faculty m ember may be entitled to take up to twenty -six (26) weeks of leave to care for a \nservice member injured in the line of duty. Occupational Health assists in determining if this \nleave applies. In addition, a faculty member may be entitled to up to twelve (12 ) weeks of unpaid \nleave because of a qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the faculty member\u2019s spouse, \nchild, or parent is a covered military member on active duty (or has been notified of an \nimpending call or order to active duty) in support o f a contingency operation.  \nF: Pay During Leaves of Absence  \nA faculty member on an academic -year appointment on a paid leave of absence for one -half of \nthe year under current practice receives pay in six equal payments from September through", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c5ba100b-29e9-4936-966d-f43e824b83b7": {"__data__": {"id_": "c5ba100b-29e9-4936-966d-f43e824b83b7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Leave_of_Absence.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "161c0126-f70b-44b3-8801-1cabc9cd99fe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Leave_of_Absence.pdf"}, "hash": "8be220148899c45cd7a6ae83e43351db34b264c0f4ec3c4e6a257680f7c46259"}}, "hash": "0a79d89c5a0ab3d8e182a37ae8f0a8df9b746eb7cadbda16a3d8c7c8fc6709bd", "text": "February, or Ma rch through August, according to the period in which they/she/he works.  If work \nis in the spring semester, eight equal checks, beginning in January, may be requested. A faculty \nmember on leave for an entire year at full pay or some fraction of stated sala ry receives the \nsalary in twelve (12) equal payments on the regular monthly pay schedule. Since there are a \nnumber of options on employee benefits for persons on paid leave, the faculty member should \nconsult with Human Resources before beginning the leave.  Faculty members granted leaves of \nabsence without pay must confirm with the Office of Human Resources Direct Billing before \nbeginning the leave whether or not they want to arrange continued benefit coverage. If full \nbenefits are to remain in force, the fa culty members on leave must pay their share of the costs of \ncontinued benefits as scheduled.  \n \n3 Throughout Chapter 4 references are made to the Family and Medical Leave Act (commonly \nreferred to as \u201cFMLA\u201d). FMLA is a fed eral law with multiple applications. It provides for job \nprotected, unpaid leave for qualified employees, including faculty, for up to 12 weeks in a 12 -\nmonth period, for the following reasons: (1) the employee has a serious health condition; (2) to \ncare fo r a spouse, dependent child, or parent with a serious health care condition; (3) in the case \nof adoption, pregnancy, childbirth, or nursing an infant; (4) on account of a qualifying event \narising out of an employee\u2019s spouse, child, or parent being on or be ing called to active military \nservice; or (5) to care for an injured member of the uniformed services (in this last case, the leave \nmay be up to 26 weeks). FMLA is a job -protection statute and does not require that an employee \nbe paid while on an FMLA leav e. Under certain circumstances, however, the University provides \nfor such a leave to be with pay and with certain other benefits. FMLA may also apply \nconcurrently with the Tennessee Maternity Leave Act (\u201cTMLA\u201d). Read this entire chapter to \ndetermine the in terplay of FMLA, TMLA, and the University\u2019s and medical center\u2019s policies on \nparental leave.  \n4 VUMC Faculty Parental Leave Policy can be found in the last subsection of Section B.  \n5 This section addresses matters related to adoption, pregnancy, childbirth and nursing of an \ninfant. FMLA matters related to medical care for a serious health conditions are addressed in \nSections D and E, below.  \n6 This is unlike the TMLA which, in - the case of an adoption, requires that the TMLA leave \ncommence on the date the fac ulty member takes custody of the adopted child. A faculty member \non TMLA leave must not use the period of TMLA leave to pursue actively other employment \nopportunities or to work full - or part time for another employer.  \n7 FMLA is a job -protection statute, n ot a pay statute and, therefore, FMLA does not require that a \nfaculty member be paid while on FMLA leave. However, a faculty member may be entitled to \npay while on FMLA medical leave if the faculty member\u2019s medical leave is covered as an illness \nor other i ncapacity for a short duration, as addressed in Section D of this chapter or if such leave \nfalls under the University\u2019s or Medical Center\u2019s Parental Leave policies (Section B, above). [6] \nFaculty members are eligible if they have worked for the University for at least one year and for \n1,250 hours during the previous twelve months.

The timeline for the major steps in this review will be as follows:  May-June External reviewers are selected and their willingness to help is confirmed.  July Copies of your personal statement, CV (external version; see below), and representative publications are sent to external reviewers. Please consult your departmental review committee regarding the date by which these items will be needed.  Fall Copies of your course syllabi, a summary of your teaching ratings, typewritten Semester  copies of student comments, and summaries of teaching observations (at least two colleagues on two different occasions, prior to this semester) are assembled.   Confirm that your Google Scholar account is correct and public.    The tenured faculty of your department meet to discuss your candidacy for promotion and tenure and to vote.1   The chair of your department sends your tenure dossier, the results of the departmental vote, and his/her recommendation to the Dean.   The Peabody Promotion and Tenure Committee meets to consider your candidacy.   February The Dean sends your tenure dossier and his/her recommendation to the Provost\u2019s Office.  Spring The Provost\u2019s Promotion and Tenure Review Committee (PTRC) meets to consider your  Semester candidacy.   The Provost reviews your dossier.   The Chancellor decides whether to recommend your promotion and tenure to the Board of Trust.   The Board of Trust votes on your case at its late spring meeting.   You are notified of the Board of Trust action.    You will be updated on the status of your review at each stage.  External reviewers. Late in the spring semester of the academic year prior to the academic year of your review you will be asked to supply names, titles, brief biosketches, and contact information for six prospective external reviewers. The reviewers you suggest will be most credible if you select them not only on the basis of their credentials, but also because their reviews would be expected to be unbiased.  The external tenure reviewers you suggest must be full professors from distinguished universities  (preferably among the top 25) with exemplary programs of faculty in your field.                                                               1 A positive decision at each level in the review process assures the advancement of your candidacy to the next level.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b3f8fe6-85f9-41ef-8ec0-e8cedd426e10": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b3f8fe6-85f9-41ef-8ec0-e8cedd426e10", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Prep_Tenure_Review.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fa64a3b6-470d-4909-9d96-cef620dd5521", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Prep_Tenure_Review.pdf"}, "hash": "bbff995f1d8377fd42ed2ded54c361f955628213d3a8819829f4afe653c693fc"}}, "hash": "8ee38bb7e23118511f868dda6e74ada187d0bf0b47545c41ed0419539e30a95e", "text": "The reviewers you propose should have no professional or personal interest in your promotion or  tenure, as might be expected of your dissertation or thesis advisor, a co-investigator on one of your  grants, a co-author, a former colleague, a person who has supplied a letter of recommendation for you,  etc.  Such closely-connected individuals are ineligible to serve as external reviewers for your tenure  review.  Curriculum vitae.  You will need to prepare two versions of your CV:  1. External version. This CV, which will be sent to your external reviewers, should be in the same format used for your annual report of professional activities. Please be sure to date this version.  2. Internal version. This CV, which will be used only within Vanderbilt, is the external version annotated with information about the roles of individual authors of any of your papers with multiple authors. This information should be provided in a sentence or two, perhaps including percentages, for each paper (or book) with multiple authors. For example, if you produced a particular paper with two coauthors (Doe and Jones), the annotation might be something like the following: \u201cI conceived this study, collected and analyzed the data, and wrote the first draft of the manuscript (80%). Doe (15%) helped refine the design of the study and commented on drafts, while Jones (5%) assisted with the data analysis and read the final draft.\u201d The use of percentages is optional, and you will not be disadvantaged if you choose to omit them. Please be sure to date this version.  Personal statement. Your personal statement affords you an opportunity to provide a summary of your professional accomplishments and plans in the context established by the personal statement you submitted for your fourth-year review and the counseling letter you received after that review was complete. As you think about your statement for your tenure review, you should revisit your earlier statement so you can be sure to relate your most recent work to the directions you set for yourself earlier. Also, you should note how you have responded to specific suggestions that may have been included in your fourth-year counseling letter.  Please divide your statement into two separate sections: 1. Research (this section will be sent to external reviewers) 2. Teaching and Service  Your personal statement must be no longer than ten double-spaced pages (12 point type, 1 inch margins all around).  Teaching-related information. For each course you have taught at Vanderbilt, your department will be required to include the full teaching report from BLUE in its original form, including graphs, data summaries, and student comments. For evaluations that were obtained in the VOICE system (prior to 2016) please include course and departmental means and standard deviations for each question and typed student comments. In addition, a summary of all numeric ratings should be included. Please use the template available from the Dean\u2019s assistant for the summary. In addition, you will be asked to supply copies of your course syllabi. Also, the faculty review committee will report, for each class you have taught, the mean and standard deviation of the GPA of grades awarded. Finally, as mentioned above, your faculty colleagues will need to have observed your teaching prior to the fall semester of your tenure and promotion review year. Of course, you should feel free to supply other information about your teaching if you wish.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c7e8cacc-34f1-47a3-8da8-a89864f10d04": {"__data__": {"id_": "c7e8cacc-34f1-47a3-8da8-a89864f10d04", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "Reappointment_Renewal_Tenure.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5bfc3106-45e3-4ffc-bb2a-24b9a2e9ff95", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "Reappointment_Renewal_Tenure.pdf"}, "hash": "f495fee89e44e72bac8015a5b458e50e4a1e26b101fec019dd616686e15225ad"}}, "hash": "898c98db81a104b64feefbd9cbb4bea8dbce5e5109999c9164e15674f1fd5447", "text": "Procedural Guidelines for Appointment, Renewal, Promotion and Tenure  at  Peabody College of Vanderbilt University  (Approved by Peabody Faculty Council October, 2014 Revised 5/19, 3/20, 12/22)   CONTENTS     1.

The policies and procedures contained in this document are intended to sustain academic quality, to promote the professional development of Peabody\u2019s faculty, and to protect their individual rights.    The Faculty Manual (http://vanderbilt.edu/faculty-manual/) of Vanderbilt University contains rules and procedures for appointments, renewals, promotions, and tenure. It is authoritative. The guidelines that follow are intended to augment those standards by specifying rules and procedures, some of which are particular to Peabody College.    1. Initial appointments  1.1. Titles and terms of appointment  1.1.1. Tenure-track positions. The titles instructor and assistant professor designate non-tenured positions on the tenure track, unless specified as non-tenure-track at the time of appointment. Service in these positions is counted as part of the probationary period leading to a review for tenure. Instructors are appointed to a one-year term, renewable once or twice, or in extraordinary circumstances, three times. Assistant professors are appointed to an initial term of three years. An earned doctorate is required for appointment at the level of assistant professor. Those in the process of completing their doctoral work may be appointed as instructors.    1.1.2. Appointment with tenure. The titles associate professor of and professor of denote tenured positions unless otherwise specified at the time of appointment. Initial appointment as associate professor or professor is possible; promotion to the rank of associate carries tenure. Appointment to a tenured position requires that the candidate meet the conditions set forth in section 2.2 of this document.    1.1.3. Named professorships, created by the Board of Trust to honor a benefactor or someone important in Vanderbilt history, may be conferred on faculty members in recognition of accomplishments or contributions well beyond the normal expectations for their rank. Typically this is done for faculty who hold the rank of professor.    1.1.4. Non-tenure-track positions. These positions are reserved for faculty members whose main contribution is to the teaching and outreach missions of Peabody College, which lies at its core.    1.1.4.1. Practice and clinical faculty. Appointments to non-tenure-track positions with the titles instructor in the practice of or clinical instructor in   ; assistant  professor of the practice or assistant clinical professor; associate professor of the practice or associate clinical professor; professor of the practice or clinical professor require academic competence and achievement at the rank described in the position description and announcement. An earned doctorate is required for appointment at the rank of assistant professor or above. Initial appointments at the instructor rank may be for one year; at the assistant rank, for no more than three years; and at the associate and professor rank for no more than five years.    1.1.4.2. Lecturers. The titles Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, and Principal Senior Lecturer designate teaching appointments and reflect the promotion sequence. These positions require academic competence and achievement at the rank described in the position description and announcement. Duties beyond teaching, such as student advisement and program development, may be required. Ordinarily, no administrative duties are required of Lecturers. Senior Lecturers and Principal Senior Lecturers may be required to carry out administrative duties. Lecturers may be part time or full time and are appointed for terms of no more than one year. An earned doctorate is preferred but not required. Senior and Principal Lecturers require a doctorate but may be part-time or full-time teaching positions Senior Lecturers may", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "818dfa08-6ae9-4ee9-a1a1-8cdc42ed4c1c": {"__data__": {"id_": "818dfa08-6ae9-4ee9-a1a1-8cdc42ed4c1c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Reappointment_Renewal_Tenure.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f6689c42-7422-4a84-926a-5f80af0b2eb5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Reappointment_Renewal_Tenure.pdf"}, "hash": "fbedf45b7fc5b0718344988d92e53c2f6a149aa8031b7db68a9f15a5fc6e855c"}}, "hash": "fb24e5216b5f8554147e1d5a8801ad7ccb41bc5318c3049c47d9e7fb3c76936a", "text": "4   be appointed for terms of no more than three years; Principal Senior Lecturers may be appointed for terms of no more than five years.    1.1.5. Research professor. Appointees to the ranks of research assistant professor, research associate professor, or research professor, which are non-tenured and reserved for individuals with major grant responsibilities (e.g., Principal Investigator, PI, or co-PI), are expected to have attained recognition for scholarly investigation consistent with the respective rank. Excellence in systematic analysis or creative expression is expected. An earned doctorate is required.    Appointments are made for fixed terms, the length of which may depend on the duration of research grants or contracts held by the University of which he/she is PI or co-PI and from which the financial support of the person\u2019s salary is obtained. Terms may be renewed without limitation.    1.1.6. Titles for persons based at other institutions    1.1.6.1. Adjunct (rank) professor of  or adjunct instructor in   denotes part time faculty members who typically are practitioners in one of the professions and whose main base is at another institution. Appointment for no more than three years is possible.    1.1.6.2. Adjoint (rank) professor of or adjoint instructor in   designates a person who is based at another institution and who  contributes to Peabody\u2019s mission, usually in ways other than teaching. Appointment may be for no more than three years.    1.1.6.3. Visiting (rank) professor of or visiting instructor in is used for persons who typically are faculty members at other institutions and who temporarily transfer their main base to Vanderbilt. Such appointments may be full- or part-time and for no more than three years.    1.1.6.4. Visiting scholar is used for visitors to Vanderbilt who have faculty status at other institutions of higher education or are otherwise distinguished, and whose presence on the campus is formally recognized for periods of no more than one year. A visiting scholar normally does not have formal duties to perform at Vanderbilt and is not a member of the faculty.  1.2. Recruitment requirements    Affirmative action goals are central to all recruitment efforts.    1.2.1. Authorization to recruit at any rank other than adjunct, adjoint, or visiting requires prior approval of the dean and provost. (A one-year lectureship requires only dean\u2019s approval.)    1.2.2. Recruitment for tenure-track and non-tenure-track, multiple-year appointments requires a search committee, appointed by the dean in consultation with relevant department chair(s). This committee may include a person from outside the department making the appointment. While recruitment for a non-tenure-track, single-year appointments (lecturer appointment) does not require a search committee, it should be standard practice.    1.2.3. A proposed change to tenure-track status from a non-tenure-track position requires a full national search in which any currently employed faculty member may apply.    1.2.4. A proposed change in position from lecturer track to practice/clinical track does not require a full national search if the person holds a senior or principal lectureship. It is handled as if it were a promotion. However, such a change for a lecturer does require a full national search.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0a2f5f71-153a-49f8-a7bd-107dd22b24c8": {"__data__": {"id_": "0a2f5f71-153a-49f8-a7bd-107dd22b24c8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Reappointment_Renewal_Tenure.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "eb4c53a8-c885-45c4-84da-0f2691cb07e4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Reappointment_Renewal_Tenure.pdf"}, "hash": "470b8780797c9f25e63cf3084e07683a01f5aa54d6617f3787a7ad67d3fb37cb"}}, "hash": "e330055d4e715147b5dcfb72d5c77df0520e33283aa39d295cd6b214b3fd8a80", "text": "5     1.3. Search committees    1.3.1. Proposals for a faculty position are usually initiated by the department in which that appointment would be located    1.3.2. The committee is charged with identifying qualified candidates by means of a national search that may include: preparing advertisements in appropriate publications; personal contacts; review of candidates\u2019 vitae, publications, and recommendations of knowledgeable persons at other institutions; participating in the interview stage; checking additional references; and preparing the formal written hiring recommendation presented to the faculty.    1.4. Search procedure    1.4.1. The file for a candidate being recommended for an interview, which is compiled by the search committee, must include (a) the candidate\u2019s curriculum vitae, (b) the summarized recommendation of the committee, (c) at least three letters of reference (the number is increased to six to support a candidate being considered for a tenured position), and (d) appropriate evidence of teaching ability. The file may be presented to the chair of the department before all letters of reference have been received.    1.4.2. The search committee forwards to the chair of the department (a) the files of those identified as the top candidates (not more than three), (b) the files of the highest ranking female and highest ranking minority candidate (if not among the top candidates), and (c) its recommendation.    1.4.3. The chair of the department reviews the committee report. A preliminary, advisory faculty vote may then be held. The department chair adds her or his recommendation and forwards the complete set of files to the dean. Invitations to candidates to visit the campus may be extended only upon authorization of the dean.    1.5. Position offers    1.5.1. Following the visits of all invited candidates, the chair of the search committee will forward to the department chair the committee\u2019s written recommendation and rationale. The chair will bring the recommendation to the department\u2019s eligible voting faculty, who then vote.  Double-blind balloting is required (see Appendix A.)    1.5.1.1. Approval by a simple majority of the eligible voting faculty is required for all appointments. (See Appendix A). Department chairs may appoint one-year lecturers without formal approval by department faculty in rare circumstances; however, chairs must seek the approval of the full faculty prior to reappointment.    1.5.1.2. Offers of appointment could be subject to a required second vote limited to those who  are entitled to vote for the rank in question. (See Appendix A.) For example, appointment at the rank of professor requires a vote of all tenured departmental faculty (regarding whether to recommend appointment with tenure), followed by a vote of the department's tenured professors (regarding whether to recommend appointment at the rank of professor). The outcome of the vote is shared with the eligible voting faculty.    1.5.1.3. The recommendation of the department is reported by the chair to the dean. If the recommendation is accepted by the dean, the candidate\u2019s file and the dean\u2019s recommendation are forwarded to the provost. If the recommendation is not accepted by the dean, the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ece6fc62-4f33-45b5-ac67-4355ea2e54a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "ece6fc62-4f33-45b5-ac67-4355ea2e54a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "Reappointment_Renewal_Tenure.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dbac336d-94b4-47a8-86ee-a3eb5755c280", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "Reappointment_Renewal_Tenure.pdf"}, "hash": "16fb927ad772607d42cbc6b299ef3bc3d73bcc76c5ca71a5f65343c6d5d624e7"}}, "hash": "fbeeaa695aa172ef8294381120df82bb34ff4da23af15b3a3c874922356ffb48", "text": "6   recommendation does not move forward. With the approval of the provost, an offer of appointment with appropriate terms can be extended. The appointment itself must be approved by the provost and the chancellor. Appointments with tenure must be approved by the Vanderbilt Board of Trust.    2. Tenure and promotion procedures    2.1. Timing of reappointment and review    2.1.1. The pre-tenure appointments of a tenure-track assistant professor typically consist of an initial three-year appointment, a two-year appointment, and a second three-year appointment, with reviews following the schedule noted below.    2.1.1.1. A departmental review conducted in the second year of service will result in a positive or negative recommendation for a two-year extension of the initial three-year appointment. In the event that an extension is not granted, the candidate will have one year remaining in his or her initial three-year appointment.    2.1.1.2. In the fourth year of service, a second review will be conducted and will lead to a positive or negative recommendation for a second three-year appointment. In the event that an extension is not granted, the candidate will have one year remaining in his or her two-year appointment.    2.1.1.3. The candidate should provide a dossier with the same content as is required in the tenure review process. Except for external letters, which are not required, the review process is the same as in the tenure review process but stops at the provost level without involvement of the University\u2019s Promotion, Tenure, and Review Committee (see below).    2.1.1.4. A counseling letter is sent to the faculty member after every reappointment review. The purpose of the chair\u2019s counseling letter, which reflects input from the dean and provost, is to provide realistic and detailed guidance, in an encouraging and supportive framework, to the reviewee regarding areas of strength to sustain, areas for improvement, and an evaluation of whether or not the faculty member is on track for promotion as well as guidelines for achievements necessary for promotion.    Recommendations from the review report and the deliberations of the department faculty should be incorporated in a form that can help the faculty member being reviewed redirect effort (if appropriate), better understand productivity expectations, know specific steps to be taken to obtain help that may be needed to develop research or improve his or her teaching, and adjust involvement in service activities (if necessary). A copy of each counseling letter is included in the faculty member\u2019s file.    2.1.1.5. A complete tenure review will be undertaken for assistant professors no later than the seventh year of service unless an extension of the probationary period has been granted by the dean, with approval of the provost.    2.1.1.6. In the event that promotion and tenure are not granted, the candidate will have one year remaining in his or her second three-year appointment.    2.1.2. Any deviation from the standard appointment and review sequence described above must be clarified in the original letter of appointment or in a subsequent letter if the original time line is amended. Any amendments must be approved by the dean and provost.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0e383462-9097-4f99-9154-efd5cc8a8f30": {"__data__": {"id_": "0e383462-9097-4f99-9154-efd5cc8a8f30", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Reappointment_Renewal_Tenure.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "55bf81c1-a10e-4a61-b136-4e74123639b4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Reappointment_Renewal_Tenure.pdf"}, "hash": "685439a8813777236183db6c5832ae89b90af153e598d34a4d8e0f8036190e61"}}, "hash": "53749354d04d23e806b32a75992240eed9110ae57bc158a337cd332e9071e6d1", "text": "7     2.1.3. Review for promotion and tenure may occur early at the request of the candidate. This is advisable only when the candidate's CV is exceptionally strong compared to the typical CV of a Peabody faculty member being considered for promotion and tenure.    2.1.4. During the spring semester prior to the tenure review year for the assistant professor (typically in spring of the 6th appointment year), the department chair initiates procedures that will lead to an appropriate evaluation of the candidate. Please see the checklist and target dates in Appendix B.    2.2. Criteria for appointment to a tenured position and for promotion with tenure    2.2.1. Tenured appointments at Peabody College require excellence in scholarship so as to gain favorable recognition in the faculty member\u2019s discipline at a national level; a high level of effectiveness in teaching; and satisfactory service to the University and the larger professional community.    2.2.2. While it is expected that the faculty of Peabody College will be involved in varying scholarly activities that produce different products, those products are evaluated by a set of common criteria to establish whether the candidate\u2019s scholarship embodies: (a) substantive contribution to new knowledge that may include contributions to theory, practice, and the development of analytical methods; (b) creative interpretation and use of ideas; (c) appropriate and logical rigor or methodology that is consistent with best practices in the conduct of research; (d) logical scope and progression of scholarship with a well-defined and sustained program of research; (e) integrity; and(f) importance as determined by professional peers. These products must be public-scholarship representing intellectual and creative work that is reviewed and validated by peers.    Standards of rigor, originality, and importance may vary from one field to another and are interpreted in the context of the candidate\u2019s discipline; however, in each case, Vanderbilt expects the level of quality and achievement to be equivalent to that required for tenure in leading departments of other major research universities.    2.2.3. Dissemination of knowledge through effective teaching has many manifestations, including classroom instruction and a broad range of faculty-student relationships (e.g., the faculty role of undergraduate and graduate advisor). An evaluation of each candidate\u2019s instructional activities will consider whether the:    (a) candidate\u2019s courses have been developed according to appropriate teaching goals, theory, and methodology;  (b) content of the candidate\u2019s courses reflects current knowledge and practice of the field;  (c) candidate\u2019s students have gained and/or demonstrated use of appropriate and/or relevant knowledge, skills, abilities, and/or attitudes about the particular field of study;  (d) candidate has earned respect from students and colleagues for honesty, integrity, and the ability to facilitate learning and convey knowledge; and  (e) candidate has been attentive to and respectful of the individual needs of students with regard to intellectual and professional development.    Other evidence of effective teaching also is to be provided, e.g., colleague or peer review, teaching awards, and recognition of colleagues in the profession through invitations to conduct classes, in-service workshops, or seminars.    2.2.4. Tenure-track faculty members have an obligation to make contributions to the intellectual climate of Peabody College and the University as a whole. In addition, administrative activities of a more general nature are important to the overall functioning of the College and the University and are", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77a38db7-7572-4260-844a-45654524bd80": {"__data__": {"id_": "77a38db7-7572-4260-844a-45654524bd80", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "Reappointment_Renewal_Tenure.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7ae9508d-fb70-46b5-9028-a897513e3a70", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "Reappointment_Renewal_Tenure.pdf"}, "hash": "46b7839d7baf8a950cd7fff6995748335fb913f83b27bd38a0894905756d9163"}}, "hash": "35ca65c062e8710de5280a10735ebdf83196cba83f60f6af06125b65cf709b1f", "text": "8   expected of all faculty members, including those in untenured positions.

Tenure review process    At any time during the review process, the candidate may choose to withdraw from consideration.    2.3.1. Tenure dossier \u2014 The tenure dossier must contain an inclusive and complete CV, references from external peers, and sufficient documentation to support the criteria for scholarship, teaching, and service as outlined above. Appendix C contains a summary of the tenure dossier.    2.3.1.1. The candidate is responsible for providing the departmental review committee with documentation to give an accurate perspective on his/her activities both within and outside of the College community. Such materials include:    \u2022 Two versions of the candidate\u2019s current CV, both of which should be dated:  o External version. This CV, which is sent to external reviewers, should be in the same format used for the annual report of professional activities.  o Internal version. This CV, which is used only within Vanderbilt, is identical to the external version but annotated with information about the roles of individual authors of any publications with multiple authors. This information should be provided in a sentence or two, perhaps including percentages, for each paper (or book) with multiple authors. For example, if the candidate produced a particular paper with two coauthors (Doe and Jones), the annotation might be something like the following: \"I conceived this study, collected and analyzed the data, and wrote the first draft of the manuscript (80%). Doe (15%) helped refine the design of the study and commented on drafts, while Jones (5%) assisted with the data analysis and read the final draft.\" The use of percentages is optional, and the candidate will not be disadvantaged if s/he chooses to omit them. If a co-author is a student, that should be noted.    \u2022 Published scholarly writing. At least three representative publications of work completed at Vanderbilt should be provided, presumably the most impactful. They should meet at least the criteria listed in section 2.2.2, above. (It is the responsibility of the review committee to assess the significance and quality of this work, which could be accomplished by considering the reputation of the journals or press, peer evaluations, citation counts or indices, adoptions in the case of textbooks, copies of invitations requesting the candidate to write or present this work at seminars or conferences, etc.)    \u2022 Published scholarship that appears in academic journals, books, book chapters, government publications, and/or journals and aimed at practitioners also can be included in the dossier. While such publications cannot be the sole basis for which the scholarship criterion for promotion is met, they will be considered in assessing a person\u2019s contribution to knowledge. The content of the publication (see section 2.2.2 for evaluation standards), as well as the type of publication, should be the basis for the review committee to assess the degree to which it helps meet qualifications for tenure and promotion.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c8db060-d37f-48dc-a78b-3c6999b1feea": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c8db060-d37f-48dc-a78b-3c6999b1feea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Reappointment_Renewal_Tenure.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "257e9205-3b07-4d12-b55c-b6ea23a37552", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Reappointment_Renewal_Tenure.pdf"}, "hash": "2b7082bc2cb16e0a8a92ecc6b193f19e739e5b4f4781dfaa04486a010459dfed"}}, "hash": "18e508717368b0b8efa642ae7122c5d4cfe3f4851959ed465557cf6a37c7de91", "text": "9     \u2022 A personal statement, no longer than ten double-spaced pages with 12-point type, 1-inch margins:  o The scholarship section describes the candidate\u2019s programmatic line of research and indicates the candidate\u2019s past, current, and future scholarly goals and the methods used to accomplish these goals. The candidate may refer to unpublished manuscripts and work in progress as well as projected products.

This document is reviewed only within Vanderbilt.  \u2022 When preparing materials to document excellence in teaching, the candidate presents evidence that his or her teaching is highly effective. Since the judgment of teaching quality must be context dependent, it is the responsibility of the candidate to highlight the areas (e.g., classroom teaching, student supervision) where s/he determines the best performance is obtained. Evidence is not limited to, but should include (if appropriate), information about the following activities:  o Classroom instruction, with descriptive information that indicates the number of courses taught and their enrollments, the type (e.g., seminars, practica, large classes) and level of courses taught (Colleague observations are arranged by the review committee; the department provides the student evaluation data and their written comments. GPA by each class taught may be requested.)  o Learning and accomplishments of students (e.g., conduct of research, implementation of school curriculum, publications) as evidenced through the candidate\u2019s self-report, student projects, reports and/or publications, and testimonials from past students. o  Research guidance, with statements that identify the nature of the candidate\u2019s interaction with and support for students completing advanced degrees. The candidate could indicate how s/he has supported the student\u2019s research or training projects and dissertation research. Examples of students\u2019 scholarly writing that have received professional recognition should be reported. Opinion statements from students and colleagues can be submitted to document the candidate\u2019s contributions.  o Instructional improvement and innovations, as possibly evidenced by textbooks or other publication or software used to enhance instruction, course materials, and grants to support instruction. Self-reports and student evaluations, in addition to peer review, can be included to support evidence of the candidate\u2019s contributions.  o Student advising, with statements that indicate how the candidate has assisted students in achieving educational goals and counseled students to be responsible members of the University and their chosen profession.      2.3.1.2. The departmental review committee is responsible for adding to this file at least six letters from referees external to the University. At least three letters are solicited from a list of referees proposed by the candidate. The remaining letters, but at least three, are solicited from a list of external reviewers proposed by the committee. All referees are to be approved by the dean before letters are sought. The referees should be selected not only on the basis of their credentials (generally, professors from top-25 universities) but also because their reviews would be expected to be unbiased. The referees should have no professional or personal interest in the candidate's promotion or tenure (e.g., not a dissertation or thesis advisor, co-investigator on a grant, co-author, classmate, former colleague).    Relationships between the candidate and any of the referees should be indicated in the biographical descriptions of the referees included in the candidate's dossier.

Letters should contain evaluative information consistent with section 2.2 of this document and the Faculty Manual.    Using a letter template available from the Peabody Dean\u2019s Office, the department is to inform external reviewers of: (a) the procedure used to select reviewers, (b) the policy precluding the candidate\u2019s access to reviewers\u2019 letters, and (c) the policy limiting access to those College and University members involved in the actual review process.      2.3.1.3. The departmental review committee also arranges for the candidate\u2019s teaching to be observed by at least two faculty members on at least two different occasions, for a total of four observations, with reports (in the form of memoranda) sent to the committee. They also compile the student evaluation data made available by the department and provide comparisons of the candidate\u2019s ratings to the average of the department.    2.3.2. Evaluation of each candidate\u2019s professional qualifications for tenure occurs sequentially at six levels: the candidate\u2019s department of primary appointment; the dean of Peabody College, who is advised by Peabody\u2019s Promotion, Tenure, and Review Committee; the University Promotion and Tenure Review Committee; the provost of the University; the chancellor of the university; and the Board of Trust. Procedures for review at University-wide levels are spelled out in the Faculty Manual.    2.3.2.1. Department-level review (see also Appendix B)  A departmental review committee is formed by the chair with the advice of his or her faculty and in consultation with the dean. In cases where the candidate\u2019s teaching and/or research transcends the department of primary appointment, one or more persons from other departments are asked to serve on the review committee.    Unsolicited letters from faculty members outside the department or school will be included in the candidate\u2019s file only if they are provided for review by the tenured faculty prior to the vote.    The review committee assembles the evidence and submits a report to the tenured faculty. After all members of the department who are eligible to vote on the matter (see Appendix A) have had the opportunity to acquaint themselves thoroughly with the candidate\u2019s file, a meeting of the eligible voting faculty is held, the case discussed, and a vote is taken with double-blind balloting (see Appendix A). (Abstentions are counted as a negative vote.) A positive recommendation by an absolute majority of those eligible to vote is required for an affirmative decision. The majority decision should be reported to the faculty; however, no specific vote tallies should be shared.    By the end of the second business day after the vote, any faculty member eligible to vote may write a letter to the department chair for inclusion in the candidate\u2019s file expressing his or her views on the deliberations by the faculty. These letters are made available to all faculty who are eligible to vote to review and comment upon.    The department must prepare minutes or a summary of the faculty deliberations, which will be added to the candidate\u2019s file after first being circulated to the eligible voting members of the faculty to verify accuracy. Any faculty member who believes that the minutes or summary does not fairly reflect the deliberations at the meeting may submit a letter to the department chair before the end of the second working day after distribution of the minutes or summary. All such letters will be made available for review by the faculty eligible to vote and will be included in the candidate\u2019s file.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5158e681-8e87-458e-909d-e5fa13de6298": {"__data__": {"id_": "5158e681-8e87-458e-909d-e5fa13de6298", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "Reappointment_Renewal_Tenure.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "caacd6be-630e-421f-8c87-63aea42564f4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "Reappointment_Renewal_Tenure.pdf"}, "hash": "225ac46783b21a643bd088aa45531a43aeb08829c39fd69040fff74e7253b16d"}}, "hash": "09671deded9f9d751880813e7fc24779dd7a0017630a6447e641bdf8dc5de747", "text": "11   The department chair writes a letter of transmittal that reports his or her: (1) views of the full range of faculty deliberations, including the vote, (2) own analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the case, and (3) independent recommendation. Within ten business days of the vote, the department chair\u2019s letter and the candidate\u2019s file are forwarded to the dean, who shares them with Peabody\u2019s Promotion, Tenure, and Review Committee.    In the event of a negative decision, the candidate must be notified in writing in a timely manner, ordinarily within one business day. If the candidate chooses to appeal the negative vote, s/he may then submit a statement for inclusion in the file to be transmitted to the dean. All negative decisions must be reviewed by the dean (see Faculty Manual).    2.3.2.2. College-level review: Promotion, Tenure, and Review Committee    Peabody\u2019s Promotion and Tenure Review Committee serves in an advisory role to the dean.  The committee consists of five tenured professors, representing the five Peabody departments. (When a multi-year term faculty member is being considered for reappointment or promotion, a professor of the practice from any one of the five departments is added to the committee.) All committee members are appointed by the dean.  Any member of a candidate's department must recuse him- or herself from the discussion on that particular case unless it is a second- or fourth-year review. Two committee members (one as primary, the other as secondary reviewer) review materials that are sent forward from the department and present both written and oral summaries, including a critical analysis of these materials, to the full committee and the dean. If the department, upon request by the dean, can supply additional information to rectify any problems that arise during the review process, the committee considers that new information. Eventually, the committee recommends or does not recommend, in an advisory capacity only, the candidate for tenure and promotion.    2.3.2.3. The dean\u2019s review    If the department\u2019s recommendation is positive, the dean will consult with Peabody\u2019s  Promotion, Tenure, and Review Committee as detailed above. Following such consultation, the  dean may recommend the candidate for promotion and tenure, or may decline to do so. If the dean decides to recommend promotion and tenure, the dean will prepare a letter to accompany the file explaining the reasons for the recommendation.  The file is then forwarded to the provost\u2019s office.    Should the dean decide not to endorse the positive recommendation of the department, the dean should provide a written rationale to the eligible voting faculty in the department. They may appeal the dean\u2019s decision. This appeal requires an affirmative vote (with double-blind balloting; see Appendix A) of at least two-thirds of the faculty members eligible to vote on the original recommendation; it must be made within ten business days (not including vacation periods) after receiving the written report from the dean describing the rationale for the decision; and it must be directed to the University\u2019s Promotion and Tenure Review Committee. The appeals procedures limit the Committee\u2019s review to documentation included in the dossier at the time of the dean\u2019s decision.    Upon receipt of a negative departmental recommendation, the dean may either accept the departmental decision or return it to the department for reconsideration. With regard to the latter, the department can choose to either reaffirm or change its recommendation. The dean, however, may decide to accept a negative decision or recommend the candidate to the University Promotion and Tenure Review Committee. For either scenario, the dean would consult with Peabody\u2019s Promotion, Tenure, and Review Committee before rendering a decision.    2.3.2.4.

The dean can choose to appeal a negative decision by the PTRC to the provost (see Faculty Manual). The provost and the chancellor also must approve promotion and tenure before the file goes to the Vanderbilt Board of Trust for its approval. A negative decision by the PTRC (unless appealed by the dean to the provost), provost, chancellor, or Board of Trust terminates the process, with promotion and tenure denied.   2.4. Promotion to professor tenured     2.4.1. Promotion to the rank of professor at Peabody College requires excellence in scholarship, teaching at a consistently high level of effectiveness, and satisfactory performance in service. The work that is evaluated for the scholarship criterion should be more completely developed than the work reviewed for the tenure decisions at the associate level. Consistent with University guidelines, the evidence of excellence in scholarship should indicate clearly that the candidate\u2019s research program is well- directed and recognized at a national or international level.    The procedures for review for promotion to professor are the same as those for awarding tenure, except that only tenured professors will vote on the departmental recommendation to be transmitted to the dean. Promotion to professor must be approved by the PTRC, provost, and chancellor (but not the Board of Trust).    3. Reappointment and promotion of practice faculty     3.1. Mentoring    Each new assistant professor of the practice should be assigned a faculty mentor at the start of their service at Peabody College.   The role of the mentor is to assist the faculty member in navigating the reappointment and review process as well as in determining when to apply for promotion. There is a general expectation that assistant professors of the practice will be supported to seek promotion to associate professor of the practice within the first eight years of service unless the faculty member chooses not to for any reason.    3.2. Timing of reappointment and review    The first review of practice faculty with multi-year appointments commences in the next to last appointment year. Subsequent reviews are conducted in the middle of the next to last year of the appointment term.    Those with appointments exceeding one year will be notified of non-renewal no later than June 1 before their last appointment year. A practice faculty member who is not renewed for an additional term will have one year remaining on their initial appointment, unless there are grounds for disciplinary action (Faculty Manual, Part IV, Chapter 1).    3.3. Criteria for reappointment and promotion   For reappointment and/or promotion of practice faculty, Peabody College requires that the review include assessment of the candidate\u2019s scholarship, teaching, service, and administrative duties as applicable. Practice faculty are expected to be excellent teachers who provide intellectual leadership in the education and preparation of students. They should develop and implement highly engaging,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f41668da-6753-42f9-9327-d6a499860aeb": {"__data__": {"id_": "f41668da-6753-42f9-9327-d6a499860aeb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "Reappointment_Renewal_Tenure.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d179a75a-c449-4390-a21c-985b84a830ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "Reappointment_Renewal_Tenure.pdf"}, "hash": "d28fcfeac78b48063dbbc2410dda960132bb92221489f7198490e2eaa807d003"}}, "hash": "69d36f2f70c53af53a56fa982024aa70d0af0c72157e2b4f2f047331aab712b6", "text": "13   rigorous courses that reflect the conceptual framework, research, and knowledge base of their department and the college. Professors of the practice are expected to engage in scholarly activities and intellectual leadership that promote: the development of their fields, professional development, curricula, and so on, as appropriate to their job descriptions and responsibilities. Practice faculty are also expected to demonstrate a high level of effectiveness in service at the university, local, state and national, or international levels, as appropriate to their job descriptions.    Given the differentiated job descriptions that exist among practice faculty, however, it is expected that review criteria are individualized to fit the job descriptions of individual faculty members. Further, expectations for scholarship among practice faculty are not commensurate with expectations for scholarship for tenure-track faculty. Practice faculty members, chairs, and review teams are encouraged to consult the Archive of Exemplars of the Scholarship of Practice as a guide to acceptable and exemplary instances of such scholarship. These exemplars link reference(s) in the candidate\u2019s personal statement, listing(s) on the candidate\u2019s curriculum vita, and publicly-available documentation submitted to confirm the activity. However, practice faculty may always also present scholarship of a more traditional kind (e.g. publications in scholarly journals) as noted below.    To be considered in a review for reappointment or promotion, the intellectual products of practice faculty must be accessible to the larger educational community and must have impact on the field. Products of scholarship among practice faculty will vary, depending upon their job descriptions and areas of emphasis. These products might include, but are not limited to:  \u2022 publication or wide dissemination of materials, methods, or procedures relevant to their job descriptions;  \u2022 public policy briefs, institutional policy reports;  \u2022 video-based teaching and student learning cases to be used in teacher education (or other) classes;  \u2022 development of video-based, web-based, or other forms of professional development;  \u2022 assessments documenting the growth of pre-service teachers and the effects on their subsequent classroom practices;  \u2022 presentations at local, state, and national conferences;  \u2022 authored or co-authored articles in practitioner or research journals (peer-reviewed or invited);  \u2022 authored or co-authored chapters in texts; authored or co-authored textbooks or other books relevant to their job descriptions.    When candidates participate in co-authored products of scholarship, it is their responsibility to provide a means for distinguishing their contributions from those of their co-authors. The candidate needs to provide an annotated CV in the same format as the internal CV used in a tenure review process. Both the quantity and quality of the products of scholarship will be considered in   determining whether the candidate is eligible for reappointment and/or promotion.    Because scholarship criteria are more inclusive for practice faculty, department chairs and faculty in individual departments are expected to provide mentoring to determine what forms or products of scholarship will be developed, submitted, and considered. The Annual Statement of Professional Responsibilities, signed by practice faculty member and department chair (or designee) is the instrument to ensure that such mentoring occurs on an annual basis.      3.4. Reappointment reviews Practice faculty may undergo a full review or an expedited review. Approval by a majority of faculty eligible to vote on the case (see Appendix A; double-blind balloting is mandatory) is required for any reappointment.    3.4.1. A full review, which is conducted by a faculty committee, requires the preparation of a dossier that includes the following:  \u2022 a personal statement no longer than 10 double-spaced pages, 12-point font, 1-inch margins  \u2022 CV--annotated", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "31453fe2-1e9a-4220-bf03-f9aea6e9cfa4": {"__data__": {"id_": "31453fe2-1e9a-4220-bf03-f9aea6e9cfa4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "Reappointment_Renewal_Tenure.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e5904616-dbb4-46d3-b014-83ab7875c806", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "Reappointment_Renewal_Tenure.pdf"}, "hash": "4fb5a1492fe5800f8f7a675e3e1108eab25deac37c15c6cfbd7fa0da4d7bcb7a"}}, "hash": "84fd08c2250909bafc6790b3c7660894e71edf5a754e81ca0029848074a3ff5d", "text": "14   \u2022 copies of Annual Statement of Professional Responsibilities**  \u2022 copies of some of the products of scholarship  \u2022 summary of teaching evaluations (including students\u2019 written comments) ***  \u2022 for each course taught, the overall GPA for grades awarded ***  \u2022 reports of observations of teaching (responsibility of review committee to coordinate completion of observations)  \u2022 sample syllabi from at least two courses  \u2022 some form of evaluation data related to administrative/directorial responsibilities for which load is assigned  \u2022 formal or informal feedback from advisees  \u2022 letters from internal and external referees (as appropriate and/or required by the faculty committee)    ** Note that faculty members who do not complete the Annual Statement of Professional Responsibilities will be ineligible to apply for review or promotion.    *** These items are provided/verified by the department.    Observations of teaching are arranged by the faculty review committee. For assistant professors of the practice, six teaching observations involving at least three observers and at least three different class sessions, some of which are for different courses, are required. All assistant professors of the practice with a full six course teaching load should be observed at least twice in the initial year of their first term, with the remainder of observations completed prior to review. (The number of observations needed for a full review may be adjusted proportionally for those faculty with administrative release.) For assistant professors after their initial review, and for associate and full professors, four observations by at least two observers in two different classes are required. The department chair or the department faculty review committee can, however, determine that additional teaching observations are necessary.    Assistant and associate professors of the practice should be observed by colleagues of higher rank.  However, full professors of the practice under full review may be (and are encouraged to be) observed by more junior colleagues as long as at least one observation is conducted by a colleague at the same rank.  This practice is intended to foster mentoring with respect to teaching.    3.4.2. An expedited review is conducted by the faculty member\u2019s department chair, who considers teaching evaluations and the faculty member\u2019s current CV with highlighted items that have been added since the previous review. An expedited review can occur only at specific points, as described in the following sections on review procedures for assistant, associate, and professors of the practice. An expedited review does not suffice when a practice faculty member is being reviewed for promotion or is experiencing difficulty in fulfilling his/her role with competence.  3.4.3. A counseling letter is sent to the faculty member after every reappointment review. The purpose of the chair\u2019s counseling letter, which is approved by the dean, is to provide realistic and detailed guidance, in an encouraging and supportive framework, to the reviewee regarding areas of strength to sustain, areas for improvement, and an evaluation of whether or not the faculty member is on track for promotion as well as guidelines for achievements necessary for promotion.

Assistant and associate professors of the practice who will have completed a minimum of six and four years respectively, including experience at other institutions (if negotiated at the time of appointment as counting toward the minimum year requirement), can, with agreement of the department chair, request review for promotion. Review for promotion can occur in conjunction with a scheduled reappointment review or independently of a scheduled review (i.e. with the concurrence of the department chair, review for promotion may be requested prior to the time of the next scheduled review).

Since the judgment of teaching quality must be context dependent, it is the responsibility of the candidate to highlight the areas (e.g., classroom teaching, student supervision) that best demonstrate his/her effectiveness in teaching. Evidence is not limited to, but should include, if appropriate, information about the following activities:  \u2022 Classroom instruction, with descriptive information that indicates the number of courses taught and their enrollments, the type (e.g., seminars, practica, large classes) and level of courses taught, and student evaluations. (Colleague observations are arranged by the review committee.)  o Learning and accomplishments of students (e.g., conduct of research, implementation of school curriculum, publications) as evidenced through the candidate\u2019s self-report, student projects, reports and/or publications, and testimonials from past students.  o Research guidance, with statements that identify the nature of the candidate\u2019s interaction with and support for students completing advanced degrees. The candidate could indicate how s/he has supported the student\u2019s research or training projects.

Observations of teaching are arranged by the faculty review committee. For assistant professors of the practice, six teaching observations involving at least three observers and at least three different class sessions, some of which are for different courses, are required. All assistant professors of the practice with a full six course teaching load should be observed at least twice in the initial year of their first term, with the remainder of observations completed prior to review, including two observations in the year of the review. (The number of observations needed for a full review may be adjusted proportionally for those faculty with administrative release.) For assistant professors after their initial review, and for associate and full professors, four observations by at least two observers in two different classes are required. The department chair or the department faculty review committee can, however, determine that additional teaching observations are necessary.    Departments are encouraged to use the observation template approved by Faculty Council and available through the Dean\u2019s Office, but may adapt that form and format as needed.    3.5.3. Evaluation of each candidate\u2019s professional qualifications for promotion occurs sequentially at three levels: the candidate\u2019s department of primary appointment; the dean of Peabody College, who is advised by Peabody\u2019s Promotion, Tenure, and Review Committee; and the provost of the University.    3.5.3.1. Department-level review (see also Appendix D)    A departmental review committee is formed by the chair with the advice of his or her faculty and in consultation with the dean. In cases where the candidate\u2019s teaching and/or research transcend the department of primary appointment, one or more persons from other departments are asked to serve on the review committee.    Unsolicited letters from faculty members outside the department or school will be included in the candidate\u2019s file only if they are provided for review by the eligible voting faculty prior to the vote.    The review committee assembles the evidence and submits a report to the eligible voting faculty. After all members of the department who are eligible to vote on the matter (see Appendix A) have had the opportunity to acquaint themselves thoroughly with the candidate\u2019s file, a meeting of the eligible voting faculty is held, the case discussed, and a vote is taken with double-blind balloting (see Appendix A). (Abstentions are counted as a negative vote.) A positive recommendation by an absolute majority of those eligible to vote is required for an affirmative decision. The majority decision should be reported to the faculty; however, no specific vote tallies should be shared.    By the end of the second business day after the vote, any faculty member eligible to vote may write a letter to the department chair for inclusion in the candidate\u2019s file expressing his or her views on the deliberations by the faculty. These letters are made available to all faculty members who are eligible to vote to review and comment upon.    The department must prepare minutes or a summary of the faculty deliberations that will be added to the candidate\u2019s file after first being circulated to the eligible voting members of the faculty for verification.

Within ten business days of the vote, the department chair\u2019s letter and the candidate\u2019s file are forwarded to the dean, who shares them with Peabody\u2019s Promotion, Tenure, and Review Committee.    In the event of a negative decision, the candidate must be notified in writing in a timely manner, ordinarily within one business day.

The dean\u2019s review  If the department\u2019s recommendation is positive, the dean will consult with Peabody\u2019s  Promotion, Tenure, and Review Committee as detailed above. Following such consultation, the dean may recommend the candidate for promotion, or may decline to do so. If the dean decides to recommend promotion, the dean will prepare a letter to accompany the file explaining the reasons for the recommendation and forward to the provost\u2019s office.    Should the dean decide not to endorse the positive recommendation of the department, the dean should provide a written rationale to the eligible voting faculty in the department who may appeal this decision to the provost.    Upon receipt of a negative departmental recommendation, the dean may either accept the departmental decision or return it to the department for reconsideration. With regard to the latter, the department can choose to either reaffirm or change its recommendation. The dean, however, may decide to accept a negative decision or recommend the candidate to the University Promotion and Tenure Review Committee. For either scenario, the dean would consult with Peabody\u2019s Promotion, Tenure, and Review Committee before rendering a decision.    Practice faculty members who are promoted are reappointed for a term of no more than five years. A practice faculty member whose review for promotion is denied may be reappointed at his/her current rank.    4. Reappointment and promotion of lecturers    The term lecturer is used here to denote lecturer, senior lecturer, and principal senior lecturer except where criteria are different for each level.    4.1. Mentoring  Each new lecturer should be assigned a faculty mentor at their start of their service at Peabody College.   The role of the mentor is to assist the faculty member in navigating the reappointment and review process as well as in determining when to apply for promotion.  There is a general expectation that lecturers will be supported to seek promotion to Senior Lecturer within the first five years of service unless the lecturer chooses not to for any reason.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac91edd4-2fb8-4ead-b0f0-c8cee1c6b9ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "ac91edd4-2fb8-4ead-b0f0-c8cee1c6b9ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "Reappointment_Renewal_Tenure.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dbfe06d7-ff08-4161-a928-bfe7b340e2a4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "Reappointment_Renewal_Tenure.pdf"}, "hash": "da8fc7569189550d38210ad63fdefd6adf67b066621fc7aa8642409fb5acf24d"}}, "hash": "f7e3e39444bf407d694f25b984fa6c5979355d72565801e9acb3b110224e33f5", "text": "19     4.2. Procedures for reappointment  The first review of lecturers with multi-year appointments commences in the next to last appointment year. Subsequent reviews are conducted in the middle of the next to last year of the appointment term.    Lecturers with single-year appointments will be notified of renewal or non-renewal as early as possible, and in any case, prior to April 1st. Senior lecturers and principal senior lecturers will be notified of renewal or non- renewal prior to June 1 of the last year of their current appointment. A senior lecturer or principal senior lecturer who is not renewed for an additional term will have one year remaining in his/her current appointment.    4.3. Criteria for reappointment  The performance of lecturers, senior lecturers, and principal senior lecturers will be evaluated by criteria consistent with the summary of duties provided at the time of hire or during the most recent term of appointment or review. These factors may include, but are not limited to: (a) teaching, (b) student advisement, (c) program development, (d) service, and (e) administration.    Specific weighting of factors will be indicated at the time of appointment and reviewed annually in consultation with appointees based on the Annual Statement of Professional Responsibilities.  This Annual Statement will be completed in early spring prior to a conference with the chair/associate chair.   For lecturers on a single year contract, reappointment and responsibilities will be confirmed by the chair/associate chair\u2019s signature on the ASPR.      A copy of each ASPR and feedback letter (whether annual or term renewal) must be included in the faculty member\u2019s file.    4.4. Reappointment reviews   Lecturers may undergo a full review or an expedited review. Approval by a majority of faculty eligible to vote on the case (see Appendix A; double-blind balloting is mandatory) is required for reappointment.    4.4.1. Typically, a lecturer\u2019s contract renewal is based upon an expedited review (see section 3.4.2, above) conducted by the chair of the department followed by a faculty vote. The review should include consideration of teaching ratings, as well as comments of advisees and faculty colleagues. Each lecturer\u2019s performance evaluation must take into account the weighting of criteria specified in the summary of duties mentioned above. Because the maximum length of a lecturer\u2019s appointment is one year, expedited reviews of performance occur annually, with a full (committee conducted) review every five years.  ASPR conferences conducted in the third and fourth years should including planning for a lecturer\u2019s promotion to senior lecturer if desired and warranted by performance    4.4.1.1. Lecturers appointed for more than half-time service will be subject to a committee conducted reappointment review every five years (see section 3.4.1). The purposes of this review include reappointment, reconsideration of the lecturer's role in the department, and, possibly, promotion. A full review should be conducted every five years thereafter or at the time of application for promotion. Committee conducted reviews for reappointment should include at least three letters of documentation of responsibilities solicited by the lecturer. Letter writers may be from within or outside the lecturer\u2019s program or department or college. The committee should take into account examination of syllabi and a (maximum) five-page doubled spaced statement documenting the lecturer's contributions to the well-being of students, the life of the department, and to the university community.

If for promotion, the results are submitted to the dean and College review committee for further review.    4.4.2. A senior lecturer or principal senior lecturer must undergo a full review (see section 3.4.1) no later than the next to last year of his or her first appointment. This review is conducted by a faculty committee appointed by the department chair in consultation with the dean. Each performance evaluation must take into account the weighting of criteria specified in the summary of duties mentioned above and, at a minimum, must include consideration of teaching ratings, feedback from advisees, observations of teaching, and comments of faculty colleagues. If the faculty member\u2019s duties include administrative responsibilities, the performance evaluation also must take into account feedback from persons who are knowledgeable about performance in this role. The review committee presents its report to the faculty of the department who are eligible to vote on the reappointment.    Beginning after the first reappointment, expedited performance reviews (conducted by the department chair) alternate with full reviews. As with practice faculty, every other review for Senior Lecturers and every third review for Principal Senior Lecturers should be a full review. Reappointment requires approval by a simple majority of the department\u2019s eligible voting faculty (See Appendix A for eligibility). Double-blind balloting (see Appendix A) is required.    The department chair forwards the review report (if a committee was involved), the results of the faculty vote, and his or her own recommendation and supporting rationale to the dean, who decides whether to accept the recommendation as presented. Full reviews are forwarded to the College review committee. The provost (or his or her designee) must approve all reappointments at the level of senior or principal senior lecturer.    4.4.3. Lecturers, senior lecturers, and principal senior lecturers who are reappointed after a committee conducted review must be provided (typically, by the department chair) a detailed counseling letter providing formative feedback that facilitates the faculty member\u2019s professional development. This counseling letter should identify areas of strength to sustain, areas for improvement, and, if applicable, an evaluation of whether or not the faculty member is on track for promotion and what the faculty member would need to accomplish in order to be a strong candidate for promotion. Letters for senior lecturers and principal senior lecturers need to be approved by the dean.    4.5. Procedures for promotion    The procedural steps for promotion to senior lecturer or principal senior lecturer follow the procedures for promotion of a practice faculty member described above in section 3.5.    4.5.1. A candidate for promotion to senior lecturer should have accumulated a record of excellent teaching, success in advising students, substantial contributions to academic program development, satisfactory service, and (if applicable) effective administration.    While positive professional impact beyond Vanderbilt University is not a prerequisite for promotion to senior lecturer, indications of such impact are regarded as further evidence of eligibility for promotion.

For Principal Senior Lecturers: The promotion review is conducted as described in the previous section except that six letters of documentation and evaluation are required for promotion to principal senior lecturer.    The review committee presents its report to the departmental faculty who are eligible to vote on the promotion (see Appendix A). Double-blind balloting (see Appendix A) is required.    The department chair forwards the review committee report, the results of the faculty vote, and his or her own recommendation to the dean, who, after consultation with Peabody\u2019s Promotion,Tenure, and Review Committee, decides whether to accept the recommendation as presented.    4.5.2. A candidate for promotion to principal senior lecturer must have accumulated an extensive record of teaching at the highest level of quality, success in advising students, substantial contributions to academic program development, satisfactory service, and (if applicable) effective administration. While positive professional impact beyond Vanderbilt University is not a prerequisite for promotion to principal senior lecturer, indications of such impact are regarded as further evidence of eligibility for promotion.    The promotion review is conducted as described in the previous section except that six letters of documentation and evaluation are required. Refer to Appendix A for who is eligible to vote    5. Reappointment and promotion of research faculty    5.1. Procedures for reappointment    Persons holding research titles are expected to conduct research and publish at the same levels of excellence as are persons at equivalent stages of appointment and rank on the tenure track. Performance of research faculty in non-research roles may be considered in evaluating performance. However, significant responsibilities other than research should be approved by the dean. Reappointments will be based on the candidate\u2019s performance as a researcher and, when appropriate, satisfactory performance in his/her negotiated non-research role(s).    5.1.1. Notice of nonrenewal of the appointment will normally be given to the research (rank) professor at least six months before the end of the appointment. If renewal depends upon obtaining contract or grant funds still in doubt at that time, the notice may be that the University intends not to renew the appointment unless the funds are obtained.    5.2. Procedures for promotion    Promotion reviews for research faculty follow the procedures, at the college level, for tenure- track faculty. Only the candidate\u2019s scholarship and service are examined unless consideration of other non-research roles (e.g., teaching, administration) has been agreed upon prior to the review.

The composition of our community of scholars defines our capabilities, strongly influences collective priorities, and ultimately determines our trajectory. Accordingly, it is essential to make these decisions as carefully as possible, basing them upon the judgment of faculty members who are in a position to evaluate the professional accomplishments of colleagues under consideration. Several principles guide the determination of eligibility to vote and procedures for voting:   1. In general, eligibility to vote on appointment is vested in faculty members at or above the rank to which the person hired is to be appointed. Eligibility to vote on reappointment or promotion is vested in faculty members above the present rank of the person to be reappointed or promoted. For example, only associate professors and professors are eligible to vote on the reappointment or tenure decision of an assistant professor; however, assistant professors may vote on the new appointment of an assistant professor.   2. If there is no rank above the rank that is the subject of the vote, then those at the subject rank are eligible to vote. For example, professors of the practice are eligible to vote on the reappointment of a professor of the practice.   3. Because personnel decisions have long-term ramifications, those who vote should have a long- range perspective by virtue of the type of faculty position they occupy. Accordingly, persons with faculty titles limited to one-year or temporary appointments (e.g., Lecturer, Visiting Professor), in the last year of a terminal (non-renewed) contract, or with part-time appointments (less than 50%) do not vote on faculty appointments, reappointments, and promotions. This restriction does not apply to persons with full-status partial-load appointments, as defined in the Vanderbilt Faculty Manual.   4. If a positive reappointment vote would imply satisfactory progress toward the accumulation of a record that is likely to lead to a successful tenure review, then only those who will be eligible to vote on tenure are eligible to vote on the reappointment. Thus, only tenured faculty members are eligible to vote on the reappointment of a non-tenured tenure-track assistant professor.   5. Faculty members must be free to cast their independent votes without fear of retribution.   Position Offers (Appointments)   All multi-year position offers require the approval of a simple majority of the eligible voting faculty of the department(s) in which the prospective faculty member will be appointed. Voting members of the Peabody College faculty are those persons holding at least half-time, multi-year appointments in Peabody College with the titles of Instructor, Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, Professor, and Distinguished Professor; Instructor in the Practice, Assistant Professor of the Practice, Associate Professor of the 21 Practice, and Professor of the Practice; Clinical Instructor, Clinical Assistant Professor, Clinical Associate Professor, and Clinical Professor; Research Assistant Professor, Research Associate Professor, and Research Professor; and Senior Lecturer and Principal Senior Lecturer; but without the prefixes Adjoint, Adjunct, or Visiting. Eligibility for voting is defined in the table below. The eligible voting faculty (EVF) varies depending upon the rank and track of the faculty member under consideration.   Depending upon the rank and tenure status of the offer to be recommended to the dean, one or more votes may be required.   Tenure-track and tenured positions.

Decisions regarding faculty appointments, reappointments, and promotions should be informed by the independent judgment of eligible voters expressed without fear of retribution. Faculty members should feel free to vote on a particular case as dictated by their best judgment rather than concerns about how others may react. Accordingly, votes on these high-stakes decisions must be conducted with double blind balloting to ensure preservation of anonymity.    An example of an acceptable double-blind balloting procedure is the following:    1. Ballots are printed and inserted in small, blank envelopes.    2. Each small envelope containing the ballot is inserted in a larger envelope on which the faculty member\u2019s name and a signature line appear.    3. The envelopes are distributed at the end of the meeting in which the case is discussed or are placed in faculty boxes.    4. Each faculty member marks his or her ballot in privacy, seals it in the smaller envelope, seals the smaller envelope in the outer envelope, signs the outer envelope, and returns the set to the departmental office. A submission deadline at the close of business at least one day following the meeting allows time for reflection on the discussion.    5. A staff person logs in the set, opens the outer envelope, and places the sealed inner envelope in a box.    6. A second staff person opens the inner envelopes and tallies the ballots. Abstentions are counted as a \u201cno\u201d vote.    Each department is asked to develop and consistently apply its own rules regarding the permissibility of absentee voting. Some departments may conclude that it is essential for each voter to be present for the discussion of a particular case in order to be eligible to vote.

(This policy does not pertain to pre -tenure course release after a \nsuccessful fourth year review)  \n \n \nPurpose and Conditions of Scholarly Leaves  \n \nVanderbilt University grants scholarly leaves of absence for the purpose of advancing \nscholarship to the benefit of faculty member s and the university . A scholarly leave is granted in \nrecognition of the productivity of the faculty member. It is not an entitlement such as may exist \nin other institutions that provide sabbatical leaves. As a matter of university  policy, requests for \nscholarly leaves are generally not granted more frequently than once every six years, and a \nlonger minimum interval may apply in specific programs. Leaves will not be provided to any \nfaculty members if the leave would be taken in the terminal year. The period between leaves \nbegins with the first full academic year after the leave.  (Tenure -track faculty members who have \nhad a positive 4th-year re view do receive a one semester leave from teaching.)  \n \nScholarly leaves are not cumulative. I f more than six years have passed between leaves of \nabsence, that fact will not shorten the required interval between subsequent leaves or allow a full \nyear\u2019s paid leave instead of one semester.  \n \nUnless waived in writing by the Provost, a faculty member wh o is granted a scholarly leave is \nobligated to return to active status for at least an equivalent period immediately following such \nleave. Scholarly leaves of absence may be granted to full -time (or full -status partial -load) tenured \nand tenure -track facult y members and to full -time clinical and practice faculty members.  \n \nA scholarly leave is granted for research, w hich may consist of research, study, writing for \npublication, or some other activity consistent with a scholarly purpose. It is not intended that  \nscholarly leaves will consist of a \u201csemester off \u201d. The granting of leaves is determined after \ntaking into consideration department and college staffing requirements, availability of funds \nfrom all sources, and other factors, such as scholarly productivity  (including publications) and \nthe outcomes of previous research leaves. Because it is expected that coverage of the duties of \nfaculty members on leave will be accomplished within existing resources, strong preference will \nbe given to leave requests that wo uld not involve hiring part -time instructional staff  such as \nadjuncts or  students to cover multiple duties. This  constraint necessarily limits the number of \nscholarly leaves of absence that can be accommodated in a particular semester.  \n \nGenerally, a facul ty member on a scholarly leave is granted half -salary and full benefits for a full \nyear or full salary and full benefits for a half -year (one semester ). In some cases,  leave may be \ngranted to pursue appropriate scholarly activities that may benefit the fac ulty member and a third \nparty, such as collaboration in a research project with a colleague at another institution or \nappointment to service for a governmental agency for a defined period. Such leaves may be paid", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53f129c9-3bde-4a7a-a676-a280eb25747b": {"__data__": {"id_": "53f129c9-3bde-4a7a-a676-a280eb25747b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Scholarly_Leave.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a7488b35-8ca0-49f5-9f16-b293aec0aae8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Scholarly_Leave.pdf"}, "hash": "b6117f4d13aae154e48faea248c40c055ad980cd4f4146c931564573ec83776b"}}, "hash": "827d3cad0ace7789ab15afd647eb8489167580edde2ddd91e128ee822352d6fb", "text": "or unpaid, depending upon the specific acti vity and on whether outside funds are available to \nsupport the faculty member.

Unfortunately, financial resources are limited and may not be sufficient to defray all expenses for some trips.   The faculty travel guidelines outlined below apply to travel supported from institutional funds.  These guidelines do not apply to grant-funded travel.   Levels of Funding  \u2022 Tenure-track faculty members: Because tenure-track faculty members must build their reputations in the early years of their careers in preparation for their tenure reviews, Peabody College provides them funding of up to $4,500 per year for travel to present papers at major professional meetings1.  \u2022 Full-time tenured, practice, and clinical faculty members: These faculty members are provided up to $3,000 per year to present papers at major professional meetings.  \u2022 Full-time, on-campus, senior lecturers: These faculty members also are eligible for funding of up to $3,000 per year to participate in major national professional meetings that will facilitate their professional development relevant to their faculty role. They are asked to submit their plans to their department chair, who, upon confirming that the proposed meeting is appropriate and their involvement is consistent with their faculty role, will endorse and forward their request to the Dean\u2019s Office.  \u2022 Full-time, on-campus, lecturers:  These faculty members are eligible for funding of up to $1,500 per year to participate in major national professional meetings that will facilitate their professional development relevant to their faculty role.  \u2022 Funds are not currently available for travel by part-time faculty members.   Funding for Each Trip  Peabody will provide up to $1,500 per trip as follows:                                                         1A \u201cprofessional meeting\u201d is understood to be a conference of a professional organization at which multiple papers are presented.

Faculty on College sponsored trips are expected to use the University per diem for meal reimbursement, which covers all meals, snacks, and incidentals (e.g., tips on meals as well as baggage and porter tips). \u2022 Reasonable ground transportation, long-term or economy airport parking, and/or baggage fees.  \u2022 Reasonable airfare (economy, advance-purchase), including fees for checking luggage. \u2022 Conference advance registration fee (but not membership dues). \u2022 Hotel room (convention rate for single room). \u2022 In addition to the foregoing, the College will match, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, up to $1,000 of departmental support for full-time faculty invited to travel outside North America to present papers at professional meetings.   o For example, if a faculty member\u2019s department provides $700, the Dean\u2019s Office will provide an additional $700, for a total supplement of $1,400 which may be stacked on top of the $1,500 College sponsored trip reimbursement.   o The College match is only good for departmental travel support; grant funds and PI funds will not be matched.   o Faculty may access College matching funds only once per fiscal year.   o For purposes of this policy, Canada and Mexico are not treated as international destinations. \u2022 Under the Dean\u2019s Tax policy, faculty with Faculty Funds exceeding $5,000 must first access their Faculty Funds for professional travel before requesting College support.     Combining Sources of Funding  \u2022 Ordinarily it is not permissible to combine grant funds with Peabody travel funds. Travel that is grant-related should be grant-supported. Requests for exceptions to this restriction must be accompanied by a clear rationale (beyond the cost of the trip exceeding $1,500) that includes a summary of expenditures from the grant\u2019s travel budget and the balance remaining. \u2022 Faculty may supplement the total trip allowance with PI funds, advisor funds, etc.   \u2022 Startup funds may not be combined with Peabody travel funds unless the faculty member is early in his or her career at Peabody and provides a clear rationale (beyond the cost of the trip exceeding $1,500) that explains why the cost of the proposed trip would be a startup expense.
